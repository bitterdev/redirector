# Redirector 

Redirector is a powerful Concrete CMS add-on that enables you to manage permanent 301 redirects directly from your website’s dashboard—without relying on .htaccess or server-side configurations. Unlike traditional redirect solutions that are limited to Apache, Redirector works on the core level, making it fully compatible with all web servers, including NGINX, LiteSpeed, and others.

This makes it an essential tool for SEO-conscious site owners, especially during migrations, restructures, or domain changes. Redirector ensures that old URLs are seamlessly forwarded to their new destinations, preventing broken links, retaining traffic, and preserving search engine rankings.

With an intuitive interface, you can easily add, update, or remove redirects in just a few clicks. Whether you're moving a few pages or overhauling your entire website, Redirector provides a reliable, server-independent solution to keep your site's structure clean and search-engine-friendly.
